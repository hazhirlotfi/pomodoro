Welcome to Pomodoro Project, your key to enhanced productivity. We introduce the Pomodoro technique â€“ an efficient time management method.
Description of the Pomodoro technique:

    Each session is 30 minutes: 25 minutes of focused work and a 5-minute break.
    After every 4 sessions, enjoy a 15-minute break before starting a new cycle.
